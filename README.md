# Karabiner private.xml
My configs for karabiner to remap the arrow key cluster to the right hand PL;' cluster, among other options including WASD and such. I also swap control and caps-lock at the system level, and provide the option to detrain your dependency on the arrow keys by turning them all into caps-lock keys.

See [here](https://www.keychatter.com/2014/08/04/how-to-remap-keys-in-osx-using-keyremap4macbook-now-karabiner/) for instructions about how to get access to the private.xml file. It lives in /Library/Application Support/Karabiner/private.xml for Karabiner version 10.11.0 on OSX. YMMV.
